.env file is what the docker compose will first look while building the image and interpolate the values that are 
provided in the .env file with the values that are not hardcoded in docker-compose.yml.


.env file will be created when we run the python code and we can then launch mutiple cnatiners based on that settings .
If we want to change the settings , then we can do changes in the .env file or either re run the program
